# Forecasting and Analysis of Major Forex Currency Pairs

## 🌍 Overview
This project investigates the use of classical time series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, to analyze and forecast major Forex currency pairs, including **EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY**, and others. By utilizing historical exchange rate data, the study evaluates the effectiveness of these models in understanding trends, volatility, and price dynamics.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Limitations of Classical Models**: Traditional time series models are insufficient for accurately forecasting Forex prices. These models fail to account for the impact of **external factors**, such as:
  - Geopolitical events
  - Macroeconomic policies
  - Market sentiment and shocks
- **Forecasting Challenges**: While effective for short-term patterns, these models struggle with the complex, non-linear behaviors inherent in Forex markets.

## 💡 Recommendations
To enhance forecasting accuracy:
1. **Incorporate External Variables**: Geopolitical and economic factors should complement time series data.
2. **Adopt Hybrid Models**: Combine time series models with machine learning techniques or external factor analysis to better capture market complexities.
3. **Focus on Volatility Analysis**: Utilize advanced volatility models to address market fluctuations.
